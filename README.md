# PaymentSystem
Laboratory work â„– 4 (KP2, 2 course, 4 module). 
We are developing a payment system that allows the client to have a balance and use it to pay for orders. 
Orders consist of positions that can be weighty and quantitative. 
Position is a pair of product and its quantity/weight. 
Product contains information about what it is and its cost. The cost of goods per unit of weight or quantity is stored in the database.
